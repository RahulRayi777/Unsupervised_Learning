Unsupervised Learning:

1)K-Means clustering

Process of dividing the datasets into groups
When we don't have labelled data(target)
Grouping is done based on the Similarity Search


1)Amazon Recommendation
2)Netflix Reccommendation


Three types of clustering :

1)Exclusive Clustering
2)Overlapping Clustering
3)Hierarchal Clustering

Exclusive Clustering: Each data Object exist in one cluster only.
EX: K-Means Clustering
This is nothing but "Hard clustering" 
the cluster membership degree is either  1 or 0.

Overlapping Clustering
Ex:Fuzzy/C-Means Clustering
 Each data Object belongs to  every  cluster only
This is nothing but "Soft clustering" 

Hierarchal clustering:
Hierarchical clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to group data points into clusters based on their similarity. It creates a hierarchy of clusters, which can be visualized in a tree-like diagram called a dendrogram



K means Clustering:

steps:
1)Firstly, select the no.of clusters for example 3 
2)then select 3 randomly selected datapoint
3)Using Eucleadian distance select the least distance 
4)then after selecting the data points lets say 0.1 and 0.4 then mean the datapoints.
5)then mean of the data points is nothing but the cluster point

Algorithm is sensitive to initial clusters

this is only single run 
based on the different runs(iterations) based on the variance of the individual cluster the iteration happens

AND selecting k- value:

for selecting k value there is elbow method where we plot variance and k value based on the best values will take k value.
