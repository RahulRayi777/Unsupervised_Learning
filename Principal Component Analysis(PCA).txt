Principal Component Analysis(unsupervised there is no target variable )

1)feature selection --> sunset of original features

2)feature Extraction---->PCA--->entire data transformation there is no subsets. There is Some reduction in the dimensionality.

Size--->No of data points
Dimensionality--->No of Features


PCA takes all the features and only captures the relevant data needed for the model building.

Cartesian coordinate representation

maximum variance gives us Maximizing Information because as some point variance is high some points are very near. That's why this.

Variance

Covariance

Covariance Matrix:::

1)a_transope=a
2)capture eigen values and eigen vectors
3)creating pais eigen values, eigen vectors
4)then we will take top k dimensions
5)plot step plot based on the information from 0 to 100%
6)based on that we will train and testing based on the propblem
 


Visualisation:::

steps:
1)check dimensons
2)convert lets say 64 d to 3 dimension
3)then Map 3d into 2D(used for visualisation also)




Drawbacks:::

---> less interpretable we cant say by seeing after transformation

---->there will be some information 

----->unsupervised there is no target variable
